A simple library for calculating multi-body motion that can use air resistance, wind, mutual gravity, total gravity

# Installing 

```bash
make install
```
This can be used without installation, you just need to copy the `flphys.c` and `flphys.h` files into the desired project,
only the standard library (including `math`) has dependencies. The `-lm` compiler/linker flag may be required to use it.

## Uninstall 
```bash
make uninstall
```

# Test
Tests the functions of the library
```bash
make test
```
# Bench
Runs simulations with different numbers of objects, with 1 ms accuracy, and outputs the ratio of simulation time to real time.
```bash
make bench
```

## Structures

### Floating
To be able to change the type of variables, between 
float, double, long double, the alias pflt_t is used. By default it is double, if you want to change the type, you need to define PHYS_USE_FLOAT or PHYS_USE_LONG_DOUBLE.
```C
typedef double pflt_t;
//typedef float pflt_t;
//typedef long double pflt_t;
```

### Vector

A three-dimensional vector that is used in all vector quantities, it is better to store values in SI units, you can create an instance of it: `(pvec-t){x, y, z}`

```C
typedef struct {
   pflt_t x; // m | m/s | N
   pflt_t y; // m | m/s | N
   pflt_t z; // m | m/s | N
} pvec_t;
```
### Object

The structure of an object that contains its position, velocity, mass, radius, cross-sectional area, volume, and the force acting on it. The object is considered to be a ball, the cross-sectional area and volume are calculated at creation using the appropriate formulas. The field `force` is needed as a buffer for calculations.

```C
typedef struct {
    pvec_t pos;    //m
    pvec_t mov;    //m/s
    pflt_t mass;   //kg
    pflt_t radius; //m
    pflt_t area;   //m^2
    pflt_t volume; //m^3
    pvec_t force;  //N
} pobj_t;
```
### Scene

The scene uniting the objects, through which all calculations are performed. Stores environment parameters, pointer to objects and their number. Also in `time` stores the total simulation time in seconds.

```C
typedef struct {
    pflt_t density;           //ambient air density kg/m^3
    pvec_t accel_of_gravity;  //constant acceleration acting on all objects m/s^2
    pvec_t wind;              //ambien wind m/s
    bool is_gravity;          //inter-object gravity flag
    pflt_t time;              //total simulation time
    pobj_t * objects;         //pointer to objects array
    size_t objects_num;       //number of objects in array
} phys_t;
```
### Result

The enumeration returned by the motion calculation functions
* `PHYS_OK` - successfully
* `PHYS_ERR_NULL_PTR` - pointer to objects is null when their number is greater than 0
* `PHYS_ERR_ZERO_DIST` - 2 objects are at the same point, with gravity turned on
* `PHYS_ERR_ZERO_MASS` - massless object
```C
typedef enum {
    PHYS_OK = 0,
    PHYS_ERR_NULL_PTR, 
    PHYS_ERR_ZERO_DIST,
    PHYS_ERR_ZERO_MASS
} pres_t;
```


## Functions

### pvec_scs_create()

Alternatively, you can create a vector by its length and angles XOY and ZOY (radians), for two-dimensional simulations the angle ZOY must be equal to PI/2. Returns initialized vector.

```C
pvec_t pvec_scs_create(pflt_t len, pflt_t xy_angle, pflt_t zy_angle);
```

### pvec_len()

Gets the vector and returns the calculated length

```C
pflt_t pvec_len(pvec_t vector);
```

### pvec_xy_angle()

Gets the vector and returns the calculated XOY angle in radians

```C
pflt_t pvec_xy_angle(pvec_t vector);
```

### pvec_zy_angle()

Gets the vector and returns the calculated ZOY angle in radians

```C
pflt_t pvec_zy_angle(pvec_t vector);
```

### pobj_create()
Gets the required data, computes the others, and returns the initialized object.
* `pos` - initial position of the object 
* `mov` - initial motion of the object
* `mass` - object mass
* `radius` - object radius, all objects are spherical

```C
pobj_t pobj_create(pvec_t pos, pvec_t mov, pflt_t mass, pflt_t radius);
```

### pobj_run()
Ð¡alculates the motion of the passed object along the parabola by `mov` and `force` fields, for `time` seconds. Returns `pres_t` structure (see below).  Usually used only inside the library
```C
pres_t pobj_run(pobj_t * obj, pflt_t time);
```
### pobj_set_radius()
Sets the radius of the object and recalculates its cross-sectional area and volume.
```C
void pobj_set_radius(pobj_t * obj, pflt_t radius);
```
### pobj_set_area()
Sets the cross-sectional area of the object and recalculates its radius and volume.
```C
void pobj_set_area(pobj_t * obj, pflt_t area);
```
### pobj_set_volume()
Sets the volume of the object and recalculates its cross-sectional area and radius.
```C
void pobj_set_volume(pobj_t * obj, pflt_t volume);
```
### phys_create()
Gets the required data, computes the others, and returns the initialized physics scene.
* `pflt_t density` - ambient air density, set it to 0 if there's a vacuum around. You can use the constant PHYS_AIR_DENSITY
* `accel_of_gravity` - Free fall acceleration of the environment. Set it to 0 if there is no common gravity. You can use the constant PHYS_ACCEL_OF_FREE_FALL.
* `wind` - air movement vector
* `objects[]` - pointer to objects array
* `objects_num` - number of objects in the array
* `is_gravity` - flag enabling gravity between objects, works slowly, *O(n^2)* where *n* is the number of objects.
```C
phys_t phys_create(pflt_t density,
                   pvec_t accel_of_gravity,
                   pvec_t wind,
                   pobj_t objects[],
                   size_t objects_num,
                   bool is_gravity);
```

### phys_run()
Basic function for calculations. Calculates the movement by steps. 
* `steps` - number of steps
* `step_time` - stepping time

During a step, all objects move at an equal acceleration, after which the forces are recomputed. Smaller step times improve the accuracy of the computation, but require more repeats, usually 1us - 1ms is sufficient.
```C
pres_t phys_run(phys_t * phys, pflt_t step_time, uint64_t steps);
```
